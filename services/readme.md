# Project Management System - Microservices Architecture

This project follows a microservices-based architecture, where each service is responsible for handling specific functionality. The services are designed to be scalable, flexible, and maintainable. Below is the breakdown of the different microservices:

## 1. User Service
- **Entities**: `User`
- **Controllers**: `AuthController`, `UserController`
- **Repositories**: `UserRepository`
- **Services**: `UserService`, `UserServiceImpl`, `CustomUserDetailsImpl`
- **Responsibilities**:
    - User registration and authentication (JWT-based)
    - User profile management

## 2. Project Service
- **Entities**: `Project`
- **Controllers**: `ProjectController`
- **Repositories**: `ProjectRepository`
- **Services**: `ProjectService`, `ProjectServiceImpl`
- **Responsibilities**:
    - Project creation and updates
    - Project-related data retrieval

## 3. Issue Tracking Service
- **Entities**: `Issue`, `Comment`
- **Controllers**: `IssueController`, `CommentController`
- **Repositories**: `IssueRepository`, `CommentRepository`
- **Services**: `IssueService`, `IssueServiceImpl`, `CommentService`, `CommentServiceImpl`
- **Responsibilities**:
    - Issue tracking
    - Managing comments on issues
    - Issue status management

## 4. Chat Service
- **Entities**: `Chat`, `Message`
- **Controllers**: `MessageController`
- **Repositories**: `ChatRepository`, `MessageRepository`
- **Services**: `ChatService`, `ChatServiceImpl`, `MessageService`, `MessageServiceImpl`
- **Responsibilities**:
    - Real-time messaging
    - Communication features between users within a project

## 5. Subscription and Payment Service
- **Entities**: `Subscription`, `PlanType`
- **Controllers**: `SubscriptionController`, `PaymentController`
- **Repositories**: `SubscriptionRepository`
- **Services**: `SubscriptionService`, `SubscriptionServiceImpl`, `PaymentService`, `PaymentServiceImpl`
- **Responsibilities**:
    - User subscription management
    - Payment plan management
    - Payment processing

## 6. Invitation Service
- **Entities**: `Invitation`
- **Controllers**: `InvitationController`
- **Repositories**: `InvitationRepository`
- **Services**: `InvitationService`, `InvitationServiceImpl`
- **Responsibilities**:
    - User invitations to projects
    - Invitation management
    - Notifications for invitations

## 7. Notification/Email Service
- **Entities**: None specific, but may include templates or history
- **Repositories**: None (or `NotificationRepository` if needed)
- **Services**: `EmailService`, `EmailServiceImpl`
- **Responsibilities**:
    - Managing notifications
    - Sending emails for invitations, project updates, and reminders

## Steps to Implement:

### Database Segmentation:
Each microservice can have its own database or schema. For example, the User Service can have a `user_db`, and the Project Service can have a `project_db`. Use separate databases or a shared one depending on your requirements and ensure loose coupling.

### Communication Between Microservices:
- Use REST APIs or messaging queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for asynchronous communication between services.
- Utilize an API Gateway to route requests, handle load balancing, authentication, and logging.

### Security:
- Centralize authentication through the User Service and use JWTs for secure communication between services.
- The API Gateway can also handle token validation.

### Deployment:
- Each microservice should be independently deployable, allowing you to scale specific services based on load. For example, the Chat Service may require more instances to handle high message traffic.

### Monitoring and Logging:
- Implement distributed logging (e.g., ELK Stack) and monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track the behavior of each microservice and maintain overall system health.

By dividing the services this way, the system will be more scalable, flexible, and maintainable. Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently based on its own demands.
